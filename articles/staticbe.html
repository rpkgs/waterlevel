<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>This vignette covers the static barometric/loading efficiency (BE/LE)
calculations in the <strong>waterlevels</strong> package. We will use a
dataset collected from a fractured sandstone site (called
<em>transducer</em>) as an example which has 1.5 month of data collected
every 2 minutes and columns called <em>datetime</em>, <em>wl</em>,
<em>et</em>, and <em>baro</em> which corresponds to the date and time of
the analysis, the water level pressure from a non-vented submerged
transducer, the synthetic Earth tide, and the atmospheric pressure from
a non-vented transducer. We use the raw pressure measurements and the
raw barometric pressure data (i.e. there is no reason to convert to an
estimated water level for these analyses).</p>
<p>Static barometric efficiency calculations are simple to apply but it
is important to consider their applicability on a well by well
basis.</p>
<p>In particular, these methods assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>That <strong>there is no time-lag</strong> in the response between
the water levels and the barometric pressure. This response is often
called the fully confined response. If the monitoring frequency is large
in comparison to the time lag this assumption may be relaxed
somewhat.</li>
</ul>
<p>We start by loading the packages and applicable data for the loading
efficiency calculation.</p>

<h3 id="remove-a-trend">Remove a trend<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#remove-a-trend"></a>
</h3>
<p>It is often important to remove trends from the data prior to
analysis. We will remove the trend in the water level data and the
barometric pressure data using linear regression. Some methods are more
robust for handling data with complicated trends, but for this dataset,
and these analyses a linear trend should suffice. We can then replot the
values. Now that we have removed the trend we can plot the water level
pressure and the atmospheric pressure on the same figure for
coparison.</p>

<p>The two responses look very similar. At this scale it appears that
the water level response is a smoothed version of the barometric
response with a slightly diminished magnitude. Let’s explore this more
fully.</p>

<h2 id="calculate-barometricloading-efficiency">Calculate Barometric/Loading Efficiency<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#calculate-barometricloading-efficiency"></a>
</h2>
<p>There are many ways to calculate the barometric/loading efficiency. I
have tried to include as many methods as possible in the
<strong>waterlevel</strong> package and if you know of a method I missed
let me know and I will do my best to add it.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="least-squares">Least squares<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#least-squares"></a>
</h3>
<p>This method is just a simple wrapper for least squares regression
added to be consistent with the other functions in the package. The
<em>inverse</em> column is either TRUE or FALSE and deserves a few words
here. The value should be set to TRUE to signify that if the independent
variable (atmospheric pressure) increases the dependent variable
decreases (dep). This is typically the case for vented transducers and
water level obtained via a water level tape. The result of this
calculation will be a barometric efficiency. For non-vented transducers
when atmospheric pressure increases the submerge pressure reading also
increases. The result of this calculation is the loading efficiency.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Loading efficiency, when inverse == FALSE (for non-vented
transducers)</p></li>
<li><p>Barometric efficiency, when inverse == TRUE (for vented
transducers, manual measurements)</p></li>

<p>If you are interested in the residuals from the model fit or the
regression results you may specify <em>return_model</em> = TRUE. In this
method the loading efficiency is 0.83.</p>

<h3 id="least-squares-using-first-differences">Least squares using first differences<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#least-squares-using-first-differences"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the presence of background trends running the regression on first
differences can minimize their effect on the regression results. To
apply this method we have one more parameter called <em>lag_space</em>
which determines how many samples are between difference calculations.
This value is important when monitoring frequency is high. Commonly
BE/LE calculates the differences based on data collected at 1 hour
increments. So for this example where we collected 2 minute data that
translates to a lag_space of 30</p>

<p>So by using a different <em>lag_space</em> we can get agreement
between the two methods. Let’s see how other methods perform.</p>

<p>This function has the same arguments as
<em>be_least_squares_diff</em>. This method will likely suffer from a
similar problem as we saw with <em>be_least_squares_diff</em>. Let’s use
differences of 1 day as this appeared to give consistent results to the
original least squares method.</p>

<p>I like this method for data where there is a complex trend. It uses
informed judgement to fit the best BE/LE value. We supply different
values of BE which are then used to remove the barometric signal from
the data. The goal is to have a smooth curve (or a result that matches
our expectations) after the barometric pressure is removed.</p>

value do you estimate for LE? How certain are you? Why is there
stucture in the residuals? One reason is that this data is from a
semi-confined well with non-negligible well-bore storage and we have
violated the assumption that there is no time lag in the response. A
better technique for this well would have been to use barometric/loading
response functions.</p>

<p>This method uses frequency domain values and includes the Earth tide
response. The BE/LE is calculated by using ratio of the barometric
pressure harmonic (S<sub>2</sub>) and the water level harmonic
(S<sub>2</sub>) corrected for Earth tides. It is meant to be applied to
confined wells. This value is also tied to the semi-diurnal frequency
and care needs to be taken on it’s interpretation in the same way the
time based static barometric efficiency calculations are limited. See
the <a href="responsefunctions.html">response function vignette</a> for
a more complete view of the water level response.</p>
